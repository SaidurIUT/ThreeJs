# Solar System

## Overview

This project served as a learning tool to explore the fundamentals of Three.js. While working on it, I gained hands-on experience with essential concepts such as:

- Camera setup
- Lighting
- Geometry
- Materials
- Textures
- Meshes
- Scenes
- Rendering
- Animations
- Event handling

This foundational knowledge has prepared me to transition to **React Three Fiber**, which offers a declarative and React-based approach to working with Three.js.
